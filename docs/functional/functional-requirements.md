# Functional Requirements Document (FRD) — E-Credentialing CVO Platform

**Version:** 2.2
**Last Updated:** 2026-04-19
**Status:** Active — kept in sync with the shipped UI
**Audience:** Business Analysts, QA, Product, end users
**Owner:** Credentialing Manager + Product Lead

> **Positioning.** This FRD covers the full **Credentialing Verification
> Organization (CVO) platform** — internal Essen credentialing
> operations as well as the public CVO surfaces (`/`, `/cvo`,
> `/pricing`, `/sandbox`, `/changelog`, `/settings/billing`,

## 1. How to read this document

For every module the FRD captures:

- **Purpose** — what the module does for the business.
- **Actors** — who uses it and at what role tier.
- **Routes & screens** — the URL paths and the screens behind them.
- **Layout** — header, navigation, content panels, action buttons.
- **Fields** — each form field with type, requiredness, and validation.
- **Business rules** — preconditions, transitions, edge cases.
- **Messages** — error, success, warning, alert, and notification copy
  (cross-referenced with the [Messaging Catalog](messaging-catalog.md)).
- **Audit** — what audit-log entries the module writes.
- **Permissions** — which roles can read and write.

For shared definitions:

- Field validation patterns: [validation-rules.md](validation-rules.md).
- Status workflows: [status-workflows.md](status-workflows.md).
- Visual standards: [ui-ux-style-guide.md](ui-ux-style-guide.md).
- Standard copy: [messaging-catalog.md](messaging-catalog.md).

A persistent top bar shows the user's name, role badge, global search (`/`),
notifications bell, and sign-out menu.

---

## 3. Global UI rules

The following apply to every screen unless stated otherwise.

- Heading hierarchy starts with one `<h1>`. Section headings are `<h2>`/`<h3>`.
- Loading: full-page loads use shimmer skeletons; in-line actions use button
  spinners with disabled state during request.
- Empty states: every list has an empty state with a one-line explanation and
  a primary action. Standard copy: see Messaging Catalog § Empty states.
- Error rendering:
  - Inline form errors appear under the field; red text; aria-describedby links the field to the error.
  - Page-level errors render in a top banner using the `destructive` token.
- Success / warning rendering:
  - Toast notifications for transient confirmations.
  - Persistent banners for compliance / blocking warnings.
- Confirmation modals: required for destructive actions (deactivate user,
  rotate API key, delete optional records).
- Date pickers: ISO display in tables; locale-aware in inputs; backend stores ISO 8601 UTC.
- Accessibility: every interactive element keyboard-operable; focus visible;
  axe must report zero serious / critical violations.

## 4. Module 1 — Provider Onboarding

### 4.1 Purpose
Capture a new provider end-to-end: invitation, account, application form,
documents, attestation, and handoff to PSV.

### 4.2 Actors
- Specialist (initiate, manage)
- Manager (override, reassign)
- Provider (complete application + attestation)

### 4.3 Routes & screens
- `(staff)/providers` — provider list (entry point for "+ New Provider").
- `(staff)/providers/[id]` — provider detail; tab "Onboarding".
- `/(provider)/application` — provider portal application.
- `/(provider)/application/sections/[section]` — per-section pages.
- `/attestation` — final attestation.
- `/upload` — provider document upload (multipart).

### 4.4 "+ New Provider" modal (staff)

| Field | Type | Required | Validation |
|---|---|---|---|
| First Name | text | yes | 2–60 chars; letters, spaces, `'`, `-` |
| Middle Name | text | no | ≤ 30 chars |
| Last Name | text | yes | 2–60 chars; letters, spaces, `'`, `-` |
| Provider Type | select | yes | Must be active in `ProviderType` table |
| NPI | text | no | exactly 10 digits; Luhn check (NPI checksum); uniqueness checked |
| Personal Email | email | no | RFC 5322; ≤ 254 chars |
| Mobile Phone | phone | no | E.164 or US 10-digit; auto-formatted |
| Assigned Specialist | select | no | Active staff users with role `SPECIALIST` or higher |

**Submit behaviour:** Provider record created with `status = INVITED`. If
"Send invite now" is checked, an invite email is queued. Audit row written:
`provider.created`.

**Inline validation messages:** see Messaging Catalog § Field validation.
Examples:

- `firstName.required` → "First name is required."
- `npi.format` → "NPI must be exactly 10 digits."
- `npi.checksum` → "This NPI failed the standard checksum."
- `npi.duplicate` → "An active provider already exists with this NPI."
- `email.invalid` → "Enter a valid email address."

**Success toast:** "Provider created. Invite is queued for delivery."

### 4.5 Provider invite email
Sent via SendGrid. Template variables: provider first name, magic link, sender
name (current user), org name, support email. Subject:
"Begin your Essen credentialing application".

Magic link points to `/(provider)/application?token=<JWT>`. Link expires 72
hours after issue.

### 4.6 Provider portal — application form (provider)
Multi-section form. Each section saves independently via
`POST /api/application/save-section`. On every save, the JWT is verified, the
`providerId` claim must match the resource, and PHI fields are encrypted at the
application layer before persistence.

| Section | Key fields | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Personal Information | Legal name, preferred name, date of birth (PHI), SSN (PHI), gender, race, ethnicity, language(s) | Race / ethnicity / language for NCQA 2026 |
| Contact Information | Home address (PHI), home phone (PHI), preferred email, work phone | |
| Education | Medical / professional school, degree, year, ECFMG # if IMG | Triggers Education PSV bots |
| Training | Internship, residency, fellowship — programs, dates, ACGME IDs | Triggers ACGME PSV |
| Licensure | Active state licenses with state, number, issue/expiry, status | Each row creates a `License` |
| DEA | DEA number, schedules, state of registration, expiry | Optional if N/A |
| Board Certification | Board, specialty, certification #, issue/expiry | |
| Work History | Past 5 years of work; gaps explained | Triggers Work History bots / verifier links |
| Hospital Affiliations | Facilities and current status | |
| Malpractice | Carrier, policy #, coverage limits, dates | Triggers Malpractice carrier bot |
| Disclosure Questions | License actions, malpractice claims, sanctions, drug/alcohol, mental health | Yes/no with explanations |
| Behavioral Health Path | NUCC taxonomy, supervision attestations, BCBS fast-track | If specialty BH |
| Telehealth | Platforms, IMLC enrollment | |
| Non-discrimination & EEO | Acknowledgement | Required by NCQA 2026 |
| References | Three professional references | Triggers reference verifier emails |

**Section save success:** "Section saved. You can return any time within the
next 72 hours."

**Section save error (validation):** Inline per field; section banner
summarises count.

**Section save error (token):** redirect to `/application/expired` page with
"Your invite link has expired or been replaced. Please contact your
credentialing specialist for a new link."

### 4.7 Provider portal — document upload
Drag-and-drop or chooser. Allowed file types: PDF, PNG, JPG. Max 25 MB per
file, 200 MB per session. Upload streams to Azure Blob via `/api/upload`. On
each successful upload a `Document` row is created with the provider's
checklist item linkage if a requirement is matched.

**Success toast:** "Uploaded {filename}. Linked to {requirement} on your
checklist." (or "Awaiting checklist match" if no requirement was matched.)

**Error messages:** size limit, file type, virus scan failure, network — see
Messaging Catalog.

### 4.8 Provider portal — attestation
Single page summarising the answers. The provider re-confirms accuracy by
typing their full legal name and clicking **I Attest**.

On submit:
- Verify token (single-use enforcement).
- Mark provider `status = DOCUMENTS_PENDING` if all required sections are
  complete; otherwise leave in `ONBOARDING_IN_PROGRESS` with a list of missing
  sections rendered.
- **Revoke the invite token** (clear `Provider.inviteToken`).
- Write audit row `provider.attested` with timestamp + IP.
- Send email confirmation to the provider; notify the assigned Specialist
  in-app and via email.

**Success page:** "Thank you. Your attestation has been recorded. You will
hear from your specialist as we complete primary source verification."

### 4.9 Status state machine
Defined in [status-workflows.md § Provider](status-workflows.md#provider). Only
valid transitions are surfaced as buttons; backend enforces the same rules
through `provider-status` service.

### 4.10 Audit
Every mutation in this module writes audit rows (`provider.created`,
`provider.updated`, `provider.invited`, `provider.attested`,
`provider.status_changed`, `document.uploaded`).

### 4.11 Permissions
- Provider record creation: `SPECIALIST` and above.
- Provider record edit: `SPECIALIST` (own panel) or `MANAGER`+.
- Reassign specialist: `MANAGER`+.
- Reissue invite: `SPECIALIST`+.
- Hard-deactivate provider: `ADMIN`.

## 11. Modules 8–20 — summary

The same level of per-screen detail exists for every module. The remaining
modules follow the same documentation pattern: routes, layout, fields,
validation, state machines, messages, audit, permissions. Detailed entries
follow.

> Note for QA: every module's per-screen tests live under
> [qa/functional-testing.md](../qa/functional-testing.md). Every UAT scenario
> lives under [qa/uat-plan.md](../qa/uat-plan.md). The Master Test
> Plan workbook ([testing/](../testing/README.md)) consolidates 250+ rows across
> modules.

### 11.1 Module 8 — NY Medicaid / ETIN
Routes `(staff)/medicaid`, `(staff)/medicaid/[id]`. Track enrollment status,
ETIN affiliation per facility, revalidation due date, eMedNY confirmation #.
Bot triggers eMedNY portal flows.

### 11.2 Module 9 — Hospital Privileges
Routes `(staff)/providers/[id]` § Privileges, plus admin-managed
`(staff)/admin/privileging-library`. Per-facility privilege application,
approval, renewal. Library catalog by specialty with CPT/ICD-10 codes; mark
core vs requested.

### 11.3 Module 10 — NPDB
Initial query and Continuous Query enrollment. Records persist as
`NPDBRecord`; flagged results surface to compliance queue.

### 11.4 Module 11 — Recredentialing
Routes `(staff)/recredentialing`. Cycles initiated 180 days prior to
anniversary. Bulk initiation via filters. Each cycle reuses the application
form (abbreviated) and re-runs PSV.

saved reports re-runnable; CSV export with PHI optionally masked.

### 11.6 Module 13 — Verifications (Work history & references)
External verifier flows under `/verify/<token>`. Token-based, no account.
Form fields per request. Submission writes a verification record and notifies
the assigned specialist.

### 11.7 Module 14 — Roster Management
Routes `(staff)/roster`. Monthly auto-generation at 03:00 on the 1st;
per-payer formatting; validation; submit (Availity API where possible,
SFTP per-payer, or email); record acknowledgments and per-row reconciliation.

### 11.8 Module 15 — OPPE / FPPE (Evaluations)
Routes `(staff)/evaluations`. Semi-annual OPPE auto-scheduled; FPPE triggered
by new privileges or events. `PeerReviewMeeting` and `PeerReviewMinute`
capture committee-level evidence with email attestation.

  Validation Rules. Cannot deactivate self.
- `provider-types` — manage provider types (active/inactive).
- `roles` — view permissions matrix.
- `integrations` — Entra group mapping, API keys, SFTP per-payer config,
  Key Vault references.
- `feature-flags` — view and toggle feature flags.
- `templates` — email and SMS templates.
- `app-settings` — toggles (auto-pause on sanction, sanctions cadence, etc.).

---

## 11A. Module 21 — Public Error Catalog (RFC 9457)

### 11A.1 Purpose
Single, public, machine-readable + human-readable catalog of every
`error.code` the platform emits from REST v1. Required by **RFC 9457
§3.1.1**: the `type` URI in every Problem Details body must dereference to
a human-readable description by anyone who has the URI. The catalog is
that destination.

### 11A.2 Actors
- **API integrators** (payers, partners, sandbox evaluators) — read JSON.
- **On-call humans, auditors, support staff, prospects** — read HTML
  pages anonymously.
- **Internal server code** — looks up entries from the typed registry.

### 11A.3 Routes & screens

| Face | URL | Audience | Auth | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| TS registry | `src/lib/api/error-catalog.ts` | server code, tests | n/a | source of truth |
| JSON list | `GET /api/v1/errors` | API integrators | API key (Bearer) | derived from registry |
| JSON entry | `GET /api/v1/errors/{code}` | API integrators | API key (Bearer) | derived from registry |
| **Public HTML index** | `GET /errors` | **Anyone** | **None** | rendered from registry |
| **Public HTML detail** | `GET /errors/{code}` | **Anyone** | **None** | rendered from registry |

### 11A.4 Layout — public HTML index (`/errors`)

- `<h1>` — "Error Catalog".
- Lead paragraph — one sentence explaining what the page is and citing
  RFC 9457.
- Search box (client-side filter over `code` and `title`).
- Category tabs / chips: `auth`, `validation`, `not-found`, `conflict`,
  `rate-limit`, `internal`, `compliance`, `billing`.
- Table (sortable): `Code`, `Status`, `Title`, `Category`, `Since`,
  `Deprecated since` (badge if set).
- Each `Code` cell links to `/errors/{code}`.
- Empty state for filtered "no matches" — copy: "No catalog entries match
  your filter."

### 11A.5 Layout — public HTML detail (`/errors/{code}`)

- `<h1>` — `{code}` (mono).
- Sub-line — `HTTP {status} · {category}` with severity-token color.
- Sections:
  1. **Title** — short human-readable name.
  2. **Description** — Markdown body explaining what happened.
  3. **Why this exists** — `rationale` (if present).
  4. **What you should do** — `remediation` (if present).
  5. **Lifecycle** — `Since vX.Y.Z`; `Deprecated since vX.Y.Z` (if set);
     `Replaced by` link to another `/errors/{newCode}` (if set).
  6. **Tags** — chips.
  7. **Example Problem body** — fenced JSON code block, copyable.
  8. **Cross-links** — to `/api/v1/errors/{code}` (JSON sibling) and to
     `docs/api/errors.md` (developer reference).
- 404 for unknown `{code}` — copy: "No catalog entry for code
  '{requested}'. The code may have been removed in a later major version;
  see [docs/api/changelog.md](../api/changelog.md)."

### 11A.6 JSON contract (`GET /api/v1/errors[/{code}]`)

```json
{
  "code": "PROVIDER_NOT_FOUND",
  "status": 404,
  "title": "Provider not found",
  "description": "No active or archived provider matches the supplied id.",
  "rationale": "Hides existence of records the caller cannot read; ID-leak prevention.",
  "remediation": "Verify the id was returned by GET /providers; ensure your API key has the providers:read scope.",
  "since": "v1.0.0",
  "category": "not-found",
  "tags": ["providers"],
  "type": "https://credentialing.hdpulseai.com/errors/PROVIDER_NOT_FOUND"
}
```

The `type` field returned in this JSON entry MUST equal the `type` URI
that REST v1 emits in any Problem body for that code.

### 11A.7 Validation, error responses, anonymous-access invariant

- `code` segment in `/errors/{code}` and `/api/v1/errors/{code}` is
  validated against the registry. Unknown codes:
  - HTML page → 404 with the "no catalog entry" copy above.
  - JSON endpoint → Problem Details with `code: "ERROR_CODE_NOT_FOUND"`,
    `status: 404`.
- HTML pages MUST NOT redirect anonymous users to `/auth/signin`. The
  middleware allow-list MUST contain `pathname === "/errors"` and
  `pathname.startsWith("/errors/")` (DEF-0007 fix; see
  [docs/qa/defects/DEF-0007.md](../qa/defects/DEF-0007.md)).

### 11A.8 Messages
- Toast on copy of the example Problem body — "Copied to clipboard."
- Empty filter — see 11A.4.
- Unknown code — see 11A.7.

### 11A.9 Audit
- JSON endpoint reads write `api.request` audit rows via `auditApiRequest`
  (already mandatory for every `/api/v1/*` request).
- HTML pages do not write audit rows (anonymous, read-only, no PHI).

### 11A.10 Permissions
- HTML pages: anyone (anonymous).
- JSON endpoints: any active API key. **No scope is required** because
  the catalog publishes only the public meaning of public error codes;
  withholding it from a caller would defeat the RFC 9457 contract that
  the same caller already needs to understand.

## 12. Cross-cutting messages, alerts, and notifications

### 12.1 Channels

| Channel | Used for |
|---|---|
| Inline form errors | Field-level validation |
| Toast | Transient confirmations and recoverable errors |
| Banner (page) | Persistent warnings (e.g., "Your session will expire in 5 minutes") |
| Modal confirmation | Destructive or irreversible actions |
| Notifications bell | Async events (bot completed, sanction flagged, new task) |
| Email | Provider outreach, committee notifications, manager escalations |
| SMS | High-urgency expirable reminders, optional 2FA fallback |

### 12.2 Severity tokens

| Token | Use |
|---|---|
| `info` | Neutral information |
| `success` | Confirmations |
| `warning` | Action recommended |
| `caution` | Approaching deadline |
| `destructive` | Errors, expirations, denials |

### 12.3 Standardized copy
All standard message strings live in
[messaging-catalog.md](messaging-catalog.md). Engineers must reference catalog
keys (e.g., `npi.duplicate`) rather than hard-coding strings.
